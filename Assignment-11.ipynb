    "#### 1. What is the role of the 'else' block in a try-except statement? Provide an example scenario where it would be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " The 'else' block in a try-except statement is executed if no exception occurs in the try block.\n",
    " It is used to execute code that should only run if the try block is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"You entered: {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Can a try-except block be nested inside another try-except block? Explain with an example. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " Yes, a try-except block can be nested within another try-except block.\n",
    " This is useful for handling different types of exceptions separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        result = 10 / num\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a number.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. How can you create a custom exception class in Python? Provide an example that demonstrates its usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom exception classes can be created by inheriting from the built-in `Exception` class.\n",
    "This is useful for defining application-specific errors.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "        super().__init__(self.message)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"This is a custom error message.\")\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Caught custom exception: {e}\")\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. What are some common exceptions that are built-in to Python? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Common built-in exceptions in Python include:\n",
    "- ValueError: Raised for invalid argument types.\n",
    "- TypeError: Raised for operations on incompatible types.\n",
    "- IndexError: Raised when an index is out of range.\n",
    "- KeyError: Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.\n",
    "- ZeroDivisionError: Raised when dividing by zero.\n",
    "- IOError: Raised for input/output operations failures.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What is logging in Python, and why is it important in software development? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Logging is a way to track events that happen during the execution of a program.\n",
    "It is important for debugging, monitoring, and auditing in software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)\n",
    "logging.info(\"This is an informational message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Explain the purpose of log levels in Python logging and provide examples of when each log level would be appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Log levels indicate the severity of the events being logged:\n",
    "- DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging.\n",
    "- INFO: General informational messages.\n",
    "- WARNING: Indications of potential issues.\n",
    "- ERROR: Errors that occur during execution.\n",
    "- CRITICAL: Severe errors causing program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "logging.debug(\"Debugging message.\")\n",
    "logging.info(\"Informational message.\")\n",
    "logging.warning(\"Warning message.\")\n",
    "logging.error(\"Error message.\")\n",
    "logging.critical(\"Critical error message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. What are log formatters in Python logging, and how can you customise the log message format using formatters? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Log formatters allow customization of log message formats, such as including timestamps, log levels, and messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "handler = logging.StreamHandler()\n",
    "handler.setFormatter(formatter)\n",
    "logger = logging.getLogger()\n",
    "logger.addHandler(handler)\n",
    "logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\n",
    "logger.info(\"Custom formatted log message.\")\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. How can you set up logging to capture log messages from multiple modules or classes in a Python application? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "To capture log messages from multiple modules, use a common logger instance and configure the logging settings globally.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "Module 1\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename=\"app.log\")\n",
    "def module1_function():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Log from module 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Module 2\n",
    "def module2_function():\n",
    "    logging.info(\"Log from module 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "module1_function()\n",
    "module2_function()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. What is the difference between the logging and print statements in Python? When should you use logging over print statements in a real-world application? \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "Logging:\n",
    "- Provides different severity levels.\n",
    "- Can be directed to files, consoles, or external systems.\n",
    "- Offers better control over message formats and destinations.\n",
    " \n",
    "Print:\n",
    "- Simpler and only outputs to the console.\n",
    "- Should not be used for production-level diagnostics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging should be used over print in real-world applications for better debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. Write a Python program that logs a message to a file named \"app.log\" with the following requirements: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Log message: \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "- Log level: INFO\n",
    "-Append new log entries without overwriting previous ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, filename=\"app.log\", filemode=\"a\", format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')\n",
    "logging.info(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 11. Create a Python program that logs an error message to the console and a file named \"errors.log\" if an exception occurs during the program's execution. The error message should include the exception type and a timestamp. \n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR, filename=\"errors.log\", format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",
