    "#### 1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Functions are advantageous because they:\n",
    "- Allow code reuse, reducing redundancy.\n",
    "- Make programs easier to read and maintain.\n",
    "- Enable modular design, dividing a program into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
    "- Allow for easier debugging and testing of individual components.\n",
    "- Facilitate abstraction by hiding complex logic behind a simple interface."

    "#### 2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",

    "The `def` statement is used to create a function in Python. For example:\n",
